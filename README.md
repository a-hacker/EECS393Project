# EECS393Project

This is the Android app side of Fragonard, our 3D scanning app.  In total, the app's functionality relies on 2 parts, the app and the server that are the server side and the app side. This functionality consists of 4 github repos : 
- The app : https://github.com/a-hacker/EECS393Project
- The server : https://github.com/Loeing/3DScanner_Server
- ORB-SLAM  : https://github.com/Loeing/ORB_SLAM   (which is a project by Ra√∫l Mur Artal that we modified to try to implement this paper(http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/MurTardosRSS15.pdf)
- BagFromImages : https://github.com/raulmur/BagFromImages (which we did not write but is necessary to run the code for the server)

This app utilizes OpenCV. Running it on a device will require having downloaded OpenCV Manager onto your device (you will be prompted to do so if it isn't).

## Installations

To run the app, clone the app and install OpenCV following this guide: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27406303/opencv-in-android-studio (note that steps 4 through 6 have already been completed).

Warning: the server has only been implemented in Ubuntu 14.04 This is particularly relevant to using ROS.

To successfully run the server you need to clone the server, ORB-SLAM and BagFrom images into the same folder, that we'll call Scanner3D. Follow the installation instructions in the ORB-SLAM readme to install ROS and ORB-SLAM. Make sure you set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to go to Scanner3D.
